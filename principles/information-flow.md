# Design the Flow of Information

Collaboration is crucially enabled by the flow of information, and we know from personal experience that the quality of the collaboration vitally depends on the quality and suitability of the received information. Edge Native applications are therefore designed foremost in terms of the information flows they ingest and emit. A complete system of many applications running on a network of edge devices will need to be designed primarily on this level as well, taking applications of known behaviour and composing them into a larger whole.

To this end, Edge Native application design puts emphasis on not only on the design but also on the documentation and formal description of its information flows. Strictly described and enforced communication protocols are necessary to ensure the successful collaboration between the different autonomous pieces. This autonomy is not only meant in an operational sense but also in the organisational sense of collaboration between applications written by different authors.
