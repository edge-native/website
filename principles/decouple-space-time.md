# Decouple Computation in Space and Time

The collaboration of autonomous edge devices occurs in a fashion that is as loosely coupled as is practical for the given functionality. This starts with the individual autonomy that demands that the end-user can expect to usefully interact with their device even while no communication is possible, i.e. information from other devices does not arrive in time. But it also includes the collaboration with applications that execute farther in the future, by persisting the facts and making them available at that later time. This kind of collaboration assumes oneway communication, and it can also occur at different locations. Information as well as computation can be moved physically from one place to the other by moving the edge device on which it exists. An Edge Native application could for example be attached to a cargo container that is shipped back and forth between Earth and Mars, interacting locally with other edge devices throughout this journey, spanning enormous distances in both space and time.
