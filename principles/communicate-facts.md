# Communicate Facts, not Interpretation

Each edge device manages its own state, its own view of the relevant part of the world. This state depends on the purpose and function of the applications it runs. Since an application on some edge device shall be autonomous from other edge devices, the state managed by each edge device is an intimate detail that is protected, hidden from the outside. Instead of communicating their state, edge devices communicate the facts that they learnt — either by recording information from their surroundings or by receiving them from other devices. This allows every device to draw its own conclusions from the facts, to apply their own interpretation to the raw data.
