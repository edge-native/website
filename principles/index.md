title: Local-First Cooperation Principles
---

The following principles give rise to IT systems that stay maximally useful to their local end-users under all conditions:

- [communicate locally](communicate-locally.html)
- [build autonomous parts](autonomy.html)
- [design parts for cooperation](cooperation.html)
- [accept uncertainty when making decisions](accept-uncertainty.html)
- [foresee dynamic changes in the network neighbourhood](foresee-network-dynamics.html)

These principles are [derived from first principles](first-principles.html).
Adhering to the above principles implies some further constraints on software design:

- [hierarchical systems to cover space and time](hierarchical-systems.html)
- [employ scoped consistency only where required](scoped-consensus.html)
- [communicate events, not state](communicate-facts.html)
- [design the flow of information](information-flow.html)
